##Authentication

This folder manages User authentication primarily through HasScopeHandler.cs.
That component checks if the given context contains the requirement's scope.

This module is used for verifying a user's permissions throughout the website.

HasScopeRequirement.cs is essentially a helper method to HasScopeHandler.cs.
